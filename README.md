<h1>InstaHack (IN PROGRESS) </h1>
<p>This is a web app to give quick instagram followers information.</p>
<p>Intended to be a simple yet safe way to checkout who do not follow you back, without the need of downloading an app or providing password.</p>

Current issue on <a href="instahack-app.herokuapp.com">deployed version</a>: Heroku workers still does not support the working tinme needed for getting all the followers list. Must find a way through.
